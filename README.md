**Description**

Making a shopping list shouldn't be hard. People may use a list on a fridge, a recipe from a relative, or even a native notes app, but these solutions are cumbersome and outdated. This is where Shopple comes in. Using your Facebook account you can download the app and be making lists in seconds. It's incredibly easy to create, organize, and check off the items you are buying. Furthermore, you can collaborate with friends and family on lists, seeing *live* updates of what you are adding and buying. With amazing features such as directions to nearby stores, notifcations to jump straight to your lists, and even Camera OCR to add items by just taking a picture, Shopple is a true upgrade to the shopping experience.

Coming to the Play Store soon!
